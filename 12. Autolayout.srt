Developing Applications for iOS, Winter of 2017,
iOS应用程序开发,2017年冬天,

5
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:16,746
This is lecture number 12, and
这是12号的讲座,

6
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:20,650
today our topic is going to be Autolayout,
今天我们的主题是自动布局,

7
00:00:20,718 --> 00:00:23,886
I'm going to review a little bit of what we already know
我将回顾一些我们已经知道的东西

8
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:25,120
about Autolayout and
关于自动布局和

9
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,057
then move onto a very important part of auto layout
然后移动到一个非常重要的部分自动布局

10
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:31,727
called size classes then we'll demo everything as usual,
称为大小类然后我们将演示一切像往常一样,

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,264
What have you seen in Autolayout already?
在自动布局已经你看过什么?

12
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,565
Well, you know about the dash blue lines,
嗯,你知道dash蓝线,

13
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:41,268
When you drag things out and move them around and
当你拖动和移动它们

14
00:00:41,337 --> 00:00:44,605
you make those dash blue lines appear you know that it helps
你让那些冲蓝线出现你知道它帮助

15
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:47,874
Xcode when you wanna do Reset to Suggested Constraints,
Xcode重置为建议限制,当你想做的

16
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:50,376
And you know that sometimes Reset to
你知道有时重置

17
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:54,446
Suggested Constraints doesn't really do what you want,
建议限制并没有真正做你想做的事情,

18
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:57,616
It really only works if those blue lines just unambiguously
真的只能如果这些蓝线明确

19
00:00:57,684 --> 00:00:58,483
obviously,
很明显,

20
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:01,152
That's what you wanted,
这就是你想要的,

21
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:04,055
But you also know that after you do something,
但是你也知道,在你做一些事情,

22
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:06,490
especially after you do reset to suggest the constraints,
特别是在你重置为建议的约束,

23
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:09,560
you can go over to the Size Inspector and
你可以去督察和大小

24
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:14,565
click on any of the views in your UI and you
点击任何UI和你的意见

25
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:17,433
can look at the constraints and it shows you them,
可以看看约束和它向您展示了他们,

26
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:19,736
You can even kind of hover over them with the mouse and
你甚至可以用鼠标和上空盘旋

27
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:21,970
they will show them on the screen,
他们将显示在屏幕上,

28
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,038
Highlight them, etc,
强调他们,等,

29
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:25,507
So that's a good tool to know what's going on,
所以这是一个很好的工具,知道发生了什么,

30
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:27,408
You also know that you can click on the constraint
你也知道,你可以点击约束

31
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:28,108
itself,
本身,

32
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:29,877
The little I beams or whatever,
小我梁之类的,

33
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:32,646
you can click on them and bring up inspector on them and
你可以点击,弹出检查员和

34
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:37,651
you can see a lot of detail: what the constants are,
你可以看到很多细节:什么是常数,

35
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,320
what's on either end of them, in other words what
在两端,换句话说什么

36
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:42,188
the constraints, the two things being involved and
参与和约束,两件事

37
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:44,724
constrained are, so you already know that as well,
限制,所以你已经知道,

38
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:49,027
You also know about control dragging
你也知道控制拖

39
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:52,097
to edges, we did a lot of control dragging to the edge
边,我们做了很多控制拖到边缘

40
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:55,400
to make our UI kinda use up all the space but
使我们的UI但有点用完所有的空间

41
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:58,502
you also saw a little bit of a hint in the smashtag demo
你也看到一点点的提示smashtag演示

42
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:02,740
that you can actually control drag between any two views,
你可以控制阻力之间的任何两个观点,

43
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:05,275
This is the key thing about Autolayout,
自动布局,这是关键的事情

44
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:08,511
It sets constraints really between any two views,
真的集约束之间的任何两个观点,

45
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,346
There's really almost no restriction
其实几乎没有限制

46
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:12,748
between the things you can set constraints,
你可以设置约束之间的事情,

47
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:15,651
Again so we'll see that in the demo a little bit today,
所以我们会看到,在今天的演示一下,

48
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,387
Now in addition to control dragging to set up these
现在除了控制拖动设置

49
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:22,724
constraints between things, you can also select them,
约束之间的事情,你也可以选择它们,

50
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:24,992
I select one view or select a couple of views,
我选择一个视图或选择一些观点,

51
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,495
And there's a couple little menus in the corner down
角落里,有几个小菜单

52
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,230
there the pin menu or the align menu and
销菜单或菜单和对齐

53
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:34,601
then this other kinda generic menu that has a lot of random
然后这其他通用的菜单,有很多随机的

54
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,436
things you can set constraints for,
你可以设置约束,

55
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:37,970
And we'll use that today as well, so
今天,我们将使用,所以

56
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,673
you can see that different way of doing it,
你可以看到,不同的方法,

57
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:42,508
Pretty much everything in there you can do with
几乎有你能做的一切

58
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:45,410
Ctrl+drag, but sometimes it's hard to do Ctrl+drag,
Ctrl +拖,但有时很难做Ctrl +拖,

59
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,245
Maybe the views are very close together, or
也许视图非常接近,或

60
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:48,712
they're really near the edge,
他们真的在边缘附近,

61
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,881
or they're overlapping some other view,
或者他们重叠的其他视图,

62
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,884
And so when that starts to be a problem, you can
所以当开始成为一个问题,你可以

63
00:02:53,953 --> 00:02:56,786
click on them to select, either using the control shift
点击选择,要么使用控制转变

64
00:02:56,855 --> 00:02:59,255
click to drill down if things are overlapping, or
点击下钻如果重叠,或

65
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:01,891
maybe use the document outline to select it, and then go to
也许使用文档大纲以选择它,然后去

66
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,128
these menus to apply whatever constraints that you want,
这些菜单应用任何你想要的约束,

67
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,564
Now the document outline, we've showed briefly and
现在文档大纲,我们显示简要和

68
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:12,367
I'll show it again today, is really the go to place to
今天我将展示一遍,真的是去的地方

69
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:14,368
resolve problems with constraints,
解决问题与约束,

70
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:18,906
Both constraints that are insufficient, in other words
这两个约束不足,换句话说

71
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:22,442
you, you haven't put enough constraints on a view for
你,你还没有把足够的限制一个视图

72
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:25,945
the Xcode to or the IOS to know where the thing goes,
Xcode或IOS知道的事,

73
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:27,781
Or constraints that conflict,
或约束冲突,

74
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,216
Maybe you put two constraints on a views
也许你把两个限制的观点

75
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:32,318
that is like they're pulling against each other and
就像他们对彼此和

76
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:33,218
IOS doesn't know what to do,
IOS不知道要做什么,

77
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:36,254
So the document outline is the place to go to resolve
所以文档大纲是去解决的地方

78
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:39,624
all that stuff and we'll see that in the demo today,
所有这些,我们会看到,在今天的演示,

79
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:42,793
Now one thing to understand about autolayout is it takes
现在有一件事要理解自动布局是需要的

80
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:44,728
experience to master it,
经验来掌握它,

81
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:47,364
There's a lot of degrees of freedom there with those
有很多与这些自由度

82
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:49,733
constraints in terms of how you can
约束条件如何

83
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:53,703
constrain views relative to each other and
相对于彼此,限制的观点

84
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:55,905
there's just no substitute for experience,
只是不可替代的经验,

85
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,540
You just have to do it,
你只需要这样做,

86
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:01,243
So don't expect that after you see the demo today,
所以不要认为你今天看到的演示后,

87
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:02,811
And after what you've seen earlier in the course,
之后,你见过的,

88
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,213
Like, "now I am an auto layout master",
说,“现在我是一个自动布局大师”,

89
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:08,182
You will have to be designing a lot of user interfaces,
你必须设计一个用户界面,

90
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:09,617
Lining up a lot of edges,
排队的边缘,

91
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:13,119
Making things the same widths, those kinds of things,
做相同的宽度,这样的事情,

92
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:16,556
Until you learn kind of the tools enough to be a good
直到你学会一种足以是一个很好的工具

93
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,423
auto layout master,
自动布局的主人,

94
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:18,757
But once you master it,
但是一旦你掌握它,

95
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:22,128
it can be really really super powerful as you can see,
它可以真的超级强大的正如你所看到的,

96
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,331
Autolayout is also doable from code,
从代码自动布局也是可行的,

97
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,832
In other words, there is a class and
换句话说,有一个类和

98
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,968
it's layout constraint and
这是约束和布局

99
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:34,205
it has all the functionality is in the story board,
它的所有功能在故事板,

100
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,874
We rarely use it because we can do
我们很少使用它,因为我们可以做

101
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,610
pretty much anything from a story board,
几乎任何一个故事板,

102
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,111
But I'm not gonna have time to teach it,
但是我不会有时间教,

103
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,180
Obviously I have to be selective about what
显然,我必须选择什么

104
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:46,382
I can show you in this limited time available,
我可以带你在这有限的时间,

105
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,151
But you can do some pretty tricky things in code that
但是你可以在代码做一些很棘手的事情

106
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:53,354
you can't do in storyboard, but they're pretty, I don't
你不能在故事板,但是他们漂亮,我不喜欢

107
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:56,925
want to say advanced, but they are, let's say fairly obscure,
想说先进,但是他们是,假设相当模糊,

108
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:59,627
And so, if you're interested in pursuing that, maybe for
所以,如果你感兴趣,也许

109
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:00,661
your final project, or
你最后的项目,或

110
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,164
something, you can just start with NSLayout constraint in
一些东西,你可以从NSLayout约束

111
00:05:03,232 --> 00:05:10,504
the documentation, and kind of go from there,
文档,从那里开始,

112
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:17,142
Let's talk a little about rotation, auto rotation,
让我们谈一下旋转,自动旋转,

113
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:19,912
We know that when we rotate, that's one of the biggest
我们知道,当我们旋转,这是最大的一个

114
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,515
times that autolayout has to kick in and figure out where
次自动布局和找出踢

115
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,484
things go because things have dramatically changed,
去,因为事情已经发生了巨大的变化,

116
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:28,953
They're much wider than they are tall now or vice versa,
他们是更广泛的比现在高,反之亦然,

117
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:32,122
And sometimes unfortunately,
有时很不幸,

118
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:37,661
that rotation causes such a dramatic change in your UI
旋转导致这样一个戏剧性的变化在你的UI

119
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,265
that you want to actually move views around in a way that you
其实你想移动视图的方式

120
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,669
just can't say by align these edges, make these the same
只是不能说通过对齐这些边缘,使这些相同的

121
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:48,438
width, keep this separation, those kinds of things,
宽度,保持这种分离,这样的事情,

122
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:51,140
You actually want to pick them up and move them,
你真的想拾起并移动它们,

123
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:55,044
And actually, a great example of that is our calculator,
实际上,一个很好的例子,这是我们的计算器,

124
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:58,880
Our calculator, at least, not your calculator but
我们的计算器,至少不是你的计算器

125
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,183
the calculator we last saw in demo had 20 buttons, and
我们上次见到的计算器演示有20按钮、和

126
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:06,287
we had it as four across and five down,
我们把它当作四,五,

127
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:08,789
And that made a lot of sense because
做了很多有意义的,因为

128
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:11,459
in portrait mode we had a lot of vertical space and
在竖屏模式,我们有很多的垂直空间

129
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:14,327
not a lot of horizontal space, so we kinda went for the,
没有太多的水平空间,所以我们有点的,

130
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:17,530
The five high, four wide,
五个高,宽四,

131
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,033
But when we switch to landscape, now it's not so
但当我们切换到景观,现在不是这样的

132
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:22,702
good, cuz all of the buttons are squished down,
好,因为所有的按钮都是扁平的,

133
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:24,737
They're really wide and thin,
他们真的又宽又薄,

134
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:27,105
It would be much better if when we get to landscape,
这将是更好的,如果当我们到达风景,

135
00:06:27,174 --> 00:06:28,740
we could go to five across and
5,我们可以去

136
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:32,243
four down because we have a lot less space,
4因为我们有很多更少的空间,

137
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:35,112
Now, can you imagine trying to do a control drag to
现在,你能想象试图控制阻力

138
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,314
make that happen is basically impossible,
实现这个目标基本上是不可能的,

139
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:38,515
It can't be done,
不能完成,

140
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:41,985
But it's possible to do with a very important
但也有可能与一个非常重要的

141
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:44,988
feature which I'm gonna talk about in a moment here,
功能,一会儿我要讲,

142
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:49,425
Now, this kind of rotation stuff is,
现在,这种旋转的东西,

143
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,328
the problem where your view changes from landscape
视图从景观变化的问题

144
00:06:52,397 --> 00:06:54,363
to portrait and you wanna move all the views around
肖像,你想移动的所有视图

145
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:56,531
can happen in other situations too,
也可以发生在其他情况下,

146
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,667
Imagine that you have an MVC that wants to look good in
假设您有一个MVC,想看起来不错

147
00:06:59,736 --> 00:07:02,570
Landscape, but also wants to look good when it's the master
景观,还想看起来不错的主

148
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,572
of a Split View Controller,
分屏视图控制器,

149
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,574
The master of a Split View Controller kind of looks likes
的主人看起来喜欢拆分视图控制器

150
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:09,242
it's in portrait, so even though you're on an iPad,
肖像,所以即使你在iPad上,

151
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,745
let's say, sometimes you have tall and
比方说,有时你高大

152
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:14,180
skinny, just like what you have on an iPhone,
瘦,就像你在iPhone上,

153
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:19,518
So it's not just iPhone issue only or rotation issue only,
所以这不仅仅是iPhone只或旋转问题问题,

154
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:23,255
So, the solution to all this is called size classes,
因此,所有这叫做大小类的解决方案,

155
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:25,791
Now, Apple has chosen to take an approach to dealing with
现在,苹果公司选择一个方法来处理

156
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,692
this which is fairly simple,
这是相当简单的,

157
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:30,895
Which is a pretty good idea because you could imagine
这是一个不错的主意,因为你可以想象吗

158
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:34,632
a very complicated solution that tries to, basically, take
一个非常复杂的解决方案,试图,基本上,

159
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,935
into effect every possible geometry and every size,
每一个可能的几何和每一个尺寸,

160
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:40,570
You could end up writing a lot of code or a massive number
你可能会写很多代码或者一个巨大的数字

161
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,139
of auto layout constraints to make it work,
自动布局的限制使它工作,

162
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,709
So they've boiled it down to this very simple system
所以他们煮这个非常简单的系统

163
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:50,012
where they talk about size classes and a view or
他们讨论类和视图或大小

164
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:53,249
a view controller at any given time exists with
一个视图控制器存在在任何给定的时间

165
00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:54,716
a certain size class,
一定规模类,

166
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:56,384
Both in the horizontal direction and
在水平方向上和

167
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:57,551
the vertical direction,
垂直方向,

168
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,988
And the only two values that the size class can have is
唯一的类可以有两个值的大小

169
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:03,490
compact or regular,
或普通紧凑,

170
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:06,026
So regular is regular sized, and
所以常规是常规尺寸,

171
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:09,696
compact means that you're constrained in that direction,
简洁意味着你在这个方向约束,

172
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:13,733
Let's look at all our devices and
让我们看看我们所有的设备和

173
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:17,803
see when they're constrained in either compact
看到当他们限制在紧凑

174
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:21,373
in either height or width, and when they're just regular,
在高度或宽度,当他们只是普通的,

175
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:25,944
Let's talk about the iPhone first the iPhone in portraits
首先让我们来谈谈iPhone肖像的iPhone

176
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:29,714
is regular in height, plenty of height, but
身高一般、足够的高度,但

177
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:31,215
it's compact in width,
紧凑的宽度,

178
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,118
It's kinda constrained in width in that circumstance,
在这种情况下,有点宽限制

179
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:38,255
When you switch to landscape, maybe surprisingly,
当你切换到景观,也许令人惊讶的是,

180
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:42,859
iPhones are compact in both directions because even though
iphone在两个方向,因为即使紧凑

181
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:45,561
when you go to landscape, it gets quite a bit wider,
当你去风景,它变得相当宽,

182
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,329
it's still not that wide,
它还不宽,

183
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:48,764
Okay, it's not wide like an iPad,
好吧,这不是宽像iPad一样,

184
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:52,033
It's still somewhat constrained, so
还是有些限制,所以

185
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,969
they've decided to make landscape
他们已经决定格局

186
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:57,037
iPhone be compact in both directions,
iPhone是在两个方向上紧凑,

187
00:08:57,106 --> 00:09:00,173
So in portrait it's regular in height and compact in width,
所以在肖像定期在宽度、高度和紧凑

188
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:02,609
But in Landscape, it's compacted both directions,
但在景观,压实两个方向,

189
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:04,043
We will encounter into it but
我们会遇到,但是

190
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:06,278
just see it works out quite nicely,
看看它的工作原理很好地,

191
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:08,313
Now, the iPhone +s, the 6+ and
现在,iPhone +年代,6 +和

192
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,882
the 7+, those are a little different,
这是有点不同的,7 +

193
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,918
They're still compact in width,
他们仍然紧凑的宽度,

194
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,820
And regular in height in portrait but
和定期在肖像但高度

195
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,288
when you go to landscape,
当你去风景,

196
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,823
since those iPhone pluses are so
因为这些iPhone有利

197
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,993
big, that they can actually start showing that kind of
大,他们可以开始出现的

198
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:26,696
horizontal UI just like it was an iPad or something,
水平的UI就像iPad之类的,

199
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:31,734
So they are regular in width in landscape mode,
所以他们定期在横向模式宽度,

200
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,502
iPhone is compact in both,
iPhone是在紧凑,

201
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:36,906
The iPhone Plus, still compact in height, in landscape, but
iPhone +,仍然高度紧凑,在景观,但

202
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:38,040
it's regular in width,
常规的宽度,

203
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:42,176
Then the iPad,
然后iPad,

204
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:45,947
Since it's huge, is always regular in both dimensions,
因为它是巨大的,总是经常在这两个维度,

205
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,550
Both width and height is always irregular, but
宽度和高度都是不规则的,但是

206
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:50,383
that's only for
这只是对

207
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:52,752
new controllers that are taking over the whole screen,
新控制器接管整个屏幕,

208
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:53,919
If your view controller,
如果你的视图控制器,

209
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:56,154
like I said in the master of a split view,
就像我说的在拆分视图的主人,

210
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,924
you're compact width, regular height,
你习惯紧凑的宽度,高度,

211
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:03,895
Or if your multi-tasking MVC that comes out from the right,
或者如果你多任务MVC从右边出来,

212
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:05,129
you all know about multi-tasking
大家都知道多任务

213
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:05,863
in the iPad hopefully,
iPad的希望

214
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:08,532
You can drag anything out from the right and
你可以拖动任何权利和

215
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,667
pick another app, and have two apps running side by side,
选择另一个应用程序,有两个并排运行的应用程序,

216
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:11,868
Well, when you pull that thing out,
好吧,当你把那件事,

217
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:14,204
that's also gonna be a compact width, regular height,
这也将是一个紧凑的宽度,常规的高度,

218
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:21,076
Now this whole mechanism of Compact and Regular in
现在这整个机制的紧凑和常规

219
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:24,913
size classes, of course, it's built-in for devices as I've
大小类,当然,正如我是内置的设备

220
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:27,648
described above here, but it's also extensible,
上面描述的,但也是可扩展的,

221
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:31,052
So if you were to write your own thing where an MVC was
所以如果你要写自己的事MVC在哪里

222
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:33,488
embedded inside another MVC,
嵌入另一个MVC,

223
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:34,922
You could set or
你可以设置或

224
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,259
communicate whether that MVC is compact or regular,
MVC紧凑或是否定期交流,

225
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:40,093
In each of width and
在每一个宽度和

226
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:42,562
height and kind of send a message to the MVC,
高度和发送消息的MVC,

227
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,830
Hey I've constrained your height so
嘿我约束你的身高

228
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,031
make sure you deal with that,
确保你处理,

229
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,333
Or I've constrained your width,
或者我约束你的宽度,

230
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:50,234
And so, it can react to it,
因此,它可以反应,

231
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:53,104
Now, again, I'm not gonna have time to talk about that
现在,再一次,我不会有时间去讨论

232
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:57,975
in detail, but there is this bar called trait collection
详细,但这条叫做特征集合

233
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:00,143
which you can look at in a view controller,
在一个视图控制器,你可以看看

234
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:03,113
And it will tell you what your current size class is,
它会告诉你什么是你当前的大小类,

235
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:06,282
both horizontally and vertically,
从水平和垂直方向上,

236
00:11:06,351 --> 00:11:07,984
And there's a mechanism for
的机制

237
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:11,554
passing that along down to sub MVCs and views and things,
传递到子mvc和观点和事情,

238
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,390
We have the size classes, compact width and
我们有大小类、宽度和紧凑

239
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:19,327
regular width, compact height and regular height,
常规的宽度、高度和定期高度紧凑,

240
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:22,563
which makes for four different combinations right here and
这使得这里的四种不同的组合和

241
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:23,997
again, compact width and
再次,紧凑的宽度和

242
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:27,200
height is iPhones in landscape but not plus ones,
高度是iphone在景观而不是加的,

243
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,001
Compact height and
紧凑的高度和

244
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,838
regular width is the iPhone plus only in landscape,
常规的宽度是iPhone加上只在景观,

245
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:35,174
Regular height and compact width is iPhones in portrait,
常规的高度和宽度是iphone在肖像紧凑,

246
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:38,477
both plusses and regular and also like a split view master,
分和定期和也喜欢拆分视图的主人,

247
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:41,446
And then regular regular is an iPad in portrait or
然后定期定期在肖像或iPad

248
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:42,547
landscape, the whole thing,
风景,整件事情,

249
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:47,685
So if we had this normal grid and we wanted our calculator
如果我们有这个正常的网格和我们想要我们的计算器

250
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:51,321
to look good in all of them conceivably we'd have to
看起来很好,他们可以想象我们必须

251
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:57,026
write, do four different UIs for our calculator like this,
写,四个不同的ui为我们这样的计算器,

252
00:11:57,095 --> 00:12:01,130
When I Have some more vertical height,
当我有一些更多的垂直高度,

253
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,265
I go five high but
我去五高但

254
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:06,168
when I'm kind of compacted I'll go to only four high,
当我压实的我要去只有四个高,

255
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:10,439
So this would be a bit of a pain in the neck to have to do
这是有点讨厌,必须要做的事情

256
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:12,123
To make it a little easier, when we are designing,
使它更容易,当我们正在设计,

257
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:13,740
this,
这一点,

258
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,178
we also have the concept of any height or any width,
我们也有任何高度或宽度的概念,

259
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:21,181
Now if we do that, now we're down to only having to do two
如果我们这样做,我们现在只需要做两个

260
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,650
things with our calculator,
我们的计算器,

261
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:26,453
So anytime we have compact height and we don't care
所以只要我们有紧凑的高度和我们不关心

262
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:28,988
what the width is, we're going to go four high,
宽度是什么,我们要四高,

263
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:30,523
Anytime we have regular height and
只要我们有规律的高度和

264
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:33,225
we don't care what the width is, we'll go five high,
我们不关心宽度是什么,我们就去五高,

265
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,894
So that's reduced the amount of work we have to do by half,
这就是我们要做的工作量减少了一半,

266
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:39,598
And actually we can reduce it even more because we can also
实际上我们可以减少它更多,因为我们也可以

267
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,233
design any any,
设计任何任何,

268
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:44,268
This any by the way doesn't mean any like the Swift
这一切并不意味着任何迅速

269
00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:46,604
type "any", it just means any width, any height,
输入“任何”,它只是意味着任何宽度,高度,

270
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:48,705
the English word any,
英文单词,

271
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:52,142
And so we can do our designing and in fact our default design
所以我们可以做设计和事实上默认设计

272
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,811
in storyboards is to be designing any width,
在故事板设计任何宽度,

273
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,382
any height,
任何高度,

274
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,085
that are the same for the five wide case or the four wide
相同的五宽情况下或四宽

275
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:06,388
case, we can build all that in the any any mode,
情况下,我们可以构建所有,在任何模式下,

276
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:10,625
And then only have to do the stuff that's specific to
然后只需要做具体的东西

277
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:14,295
the size class being different in that case,
在这种情况下,类大小不同

278
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:18,432
So, that reduces even more the design we have to do,
这减少了更多的设计我们要做的,

279
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:20,133
Cuz we're doing most of our design any any,
因为我们正在做我们的大部分设计任何任何,

280
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:23,570
and then a little bit to make the other two work,
然后一点点让另外两个工作,

281
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,905
So, you can see it in the calculator here, the only
所以,你可以看到它在这里的计算器,唯一

282
00:13:25,974 --> 00:13:29,575
things I can do in any/any is the base keyboard there, not
我可以做的事情在任何/键盘底部,没有

283
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:32,311
including the buttons that are either gonna be on the top or
包括按钮,会在顶部或

284
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,663
because those depending on the vertical size class there,
因为这些大小取决于垂直类,

285
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:36,948
on the side,
在方面,

286
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:39,250
And also I can do my display at the top,
我还可以做我的显示在顶部,

287
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,919
If that's all I can do,
如果这是我所能做的,

288
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,405
But most of my UI we'll see in the demo I'll do exactly this,
但是我的大多数UI在演示中我们会看到我做的正是这一点,

289
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,823
That's a lot,
这是很多,

290
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:50,126
Let's jump into that,
让我们进入,

291
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:55,599
To make the demo a little easier to understand what's
使演示更容易理解

292
00:13:55,667 --> 00:14:00,069
going on here the developer, here's our calculator,
这里的开发人员,这是我们的计算器,

293
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:05,340
I actually added a little
我添加了一个小

294
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:11,880
bit of code to my calculator and
我的计算器和一些代码

295
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:16,618
I'll show it to you,
我会告诉你,

296
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:18,754
This is the calculator that we've left off,
这是我们离开,计算器

297
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:21,256
The last thing we did in this calculator was
计算器是我们做的最后一件事

298
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:22,623
the green square root,
绿色的平方根,

299
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:25,993
Remember so it was not changed since then except for this,
记住这并不改变之后,除了这,

300
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:27,528
In the view controller for this guy,
视图控制器的这个家伙,

301
00:14:27,596 --> 00:14:30,496
I added this blue code right here,
我添加了这个蓝色的代码,

302
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:32,931
I added this function showSizeClasses
我添加了这个函数showSizeClasses

303
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,267
which hijacks the display,
劫持的显示,

304
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:38,237
You know our blue display on the top, it hijacks it and
你知道我们的蓝色显示在顶部,它和劫持

305
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:40,905
writes in there what the width and
在宽度和写道

306
00:14:40,974 --> 00:14:45,810
height size classes are of the calculator in the moment okay,
高度尺寸类是计算器的时刻,

307
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:48,679
And then I just Implemented a couple of ViewController
然后我就实现几个ViewController

308
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:51,449
life-cycle methods here, viewDidAppear calls it,
生命周期方法,viewDidAppear调用它,

309
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:53,917
And then, view will transition to size,
然后,视图将过渡到大小,

310
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:55,952
which is what happens when you rotate,
当你旋转时,就会发生这样的事

311
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,522
And I just call this showSizeClasses there,
我就叫这个showSizeClasses那里,

312
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:02,558
I also added a little extension to
我还添加了一个小扩展

313
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:06,962
UI user interface size class to just have it
用户界面UI类就有大小

314
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,663
implement custom string convertible,
实现自定义字符串转换,

315
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:11,098
So it implements that method description,
它实现了这一方法的描述,

316
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,367
And just returns compact and regular,
就返回紧凑和常规,

317
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:15,603
That's so that I can do this line of code right here,
这样我可以做这行代码,

318
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:19,006
where I'm printing out the size classes,
我打印大小类,

319
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:21,474
So, it's not really important that you understand this,
所以,这不是很重要,你明白这一点,

320
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:23,242
You'll just notice that when we run it,
您会注意到,当我们运行它,

321
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:25,244
So I'll go ahead and run here,
所以我要继续运行,

322
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:28,480
You're gonna see that that blue thing is gonna get
你会看到那个蓝色的东西

323
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:31,850
taken over to show you the size class,
接管给你大小类,

324
00:15:31,918 --> 00:15:35,052
It's just cuz when you're running I want you to be clear
只是因为当你跑步我要你清楚

325
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:38,256
on what size classes we're doing both horizontally and
在我们做的水平和规模类

326
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:39,223
vertically,
垂直,

327
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:46,095
When we are in, and this is iPhone 7, So we are in
当我们在,这是iPhone 7,所以我们都在

328
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:50,267
portrait mode, so you can see that our width is compact and
竖屏模式,所以你可以看到,我们的宽度是紧凑,

329
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:52,401
our height is regular,
我们的高度是常规,

330
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,104
If I rotate, so I'm just gonna hit the Cmd key here,
如果我旋转,所以这里我要按Cmd键,

331
00:15:55,173 --> 00:15:58,674
rotate, you can see that now we are width compact and
旋转,你可以看到,现在我们宽度和紧凑

332
00:15:58,743 --> 00:16:02,144
height compact cuz we're on the iPhone 7,
高度紧凑的因为我们在iPhone上7,

333
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:05,179
If we were on iPhone 7 Plus,
如果我们在iPhone上7 +,

334
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:07,715
right now it would be width regular height compact,
现在它将宽度固定高度紧凑,

335
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:11,517
So, in the interest of time I won't run there,
因此,由于时间关系我就不跑,

336
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:14,587
but when we do come to running it we'll be able to always see
但当我们做来运行它,我们总能看到

337
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:16,389
what size class we're in,
什么大小,我们班

338
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:22,427
So, here is our UI right here,
所以,这是我们的UI,

339
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:25,430
And there's a couple of things we can do with size classes
有几件事情我们可以做的尺寸类

340
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:27,499
that are actually really, really simple,
真的,真的很简单,

341
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,668
For example, you can click on certain UI elements,
例如,您可以点击特定的UI元素,

342
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:33,671
like a label, and when you go to the attribute inspector
像一个标签,当你去属性检查器

343
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:36,406
over here you'll notice that some of the attributes have
在这里你会注意到的一些属性

344
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:37,640
these little pluses,
这些小的优点,

345
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:39,242
See that? Plus, plus?
看到了吗?

346
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:40,944
And down here, plus and plus?
在这里,+和+ ?

347
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,880
And what these pluses let you do,
这些优点让你做什么,

348
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:48,517
is change these fields in that size clause,
改变这些字段大小条款,

349
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:50,885
We can do the any/any,
我们可以做任何/,

350
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:54,922
We can do compact with compact height any,
我们能做的紧凑与紧凑的高度,

351
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:55,889
any combination we want,
我们想要的,任意组合

352
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,957
So for example here, let's go ahead and
举个例子,让我们继续

353
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:02,028
have our background color of our display up here
我们显示的背景颜色了吗

354
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:06,232
vary depending on our height size class,
取决于我们的高度尺寸类,

355
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,901
If we're height compact, we'll do one thing,
如果我们高度紧凑,我们会做一件事,

356
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,903
If we're height regular we'll do another,
如果我们高度定期做另一个,

357
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:13,671
So, we do that by pressing this little plus,
所以,我们按这个小加,

358
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,506
You see when you do that,
你看,当你这样做,

359
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:17,542
And here we can pick the width that we want,
在这里,我们可以选择我们想要的宽度,

360
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,244
And since we're varying on the height I'm just gonna say
因为我们在不同的高度我只是想说

361
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:21,445
any width,
任何宽度,

362
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:24,648
And I'm gonna say height compact, so this will,
我会说高度紧凑,这将

363
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:27,049
means that this background that it's gonna,
意味着这样的背景之下,它会,

364
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:28,851
this variation it's gonna create,
这种变化将创建,

365
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,253
will only take effect when the height is compact,
只会生效时高度紧凑,

366
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:33,923
if the height is regular, this is not going to take effect,
如果高度是常规,这是不会生效,

367
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:36,725
So, I'm gonna add a variation, you see it added it here,
所以,我会添加一个变异,你看到它补充说,

368
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:38,126
you see the little hC,
你看到小hC,

369
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:42,230
that means height compact all right, the width is any, so
这意味着高度紧凑,宽度是任何,所以

370
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,330
it doesn't say anything about width,
它没有说任何关于宽度,

371
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:44,632
And now we can change it,
现在我们可以改变它,

372
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:46,766
Let's pick, this is for high compact, so
让我们挑选,这是高紧凑,所以

373
00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:48,467
I'm going to pick cyan,
我要选择青色,

374
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:50,302
C for cyan, C for compact,
青色C,C紧凑,

375
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:52,538
hopefully you can remember that,
希望你能记住,

376
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:53,705
So, I've changed that,
所以,我改变了这一切,

377
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:56,274
Now, when I changed this, notice nothing changed here,
现在,当我改变了这个数字,注意这里并没有什么改变,

378
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,709
Why did nothing change there?
为什么没有改变?

379
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:02,280
Anyone know?
有人知道吗?

380
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:07,952
It's because we are in portrait on an iPhone here,
这是因为我们在肖像在iPhone上,

381
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,754
iPhone portrait, that is size class height regular, see,
iPhone的肖像,这是大小类高度固定,看,

382
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:15,324
down here it will always tell you what your size class is or
这里它总是告诉你你的类或大小

383
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:18,628
what you are looking at this is height regular,
你看这是高度常规,

384
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,331
So, since height regular is not height compact,
所以,既然高度常规不是高度紧凑,

385
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,866
we get the default,
默认的,

386
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:28,703
But if I switch over to here, landscape, it turned cyan,
但是如果我切换到这里,风景,它变成了青色,

387
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:30,805
Because now, I'm in landscape mode of an iPhone,
因为现在,我在iPhone的景观模式,

388
00:18:30,874 --> 00:18:34,642
which is height compact, width compact, as well,
这是高度紧凑,宽度紧凑,,

389
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,512
And if I go to iPhone 7, is it gonna be cyan here?
如果我去iPhone 7,将青色吗?

390
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:45,385
Yes, it is, because in iPhone 7 Plus, we're regular width,
是的,它是,因为在iPhone 7 +,我们常规的宽度,

391
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:48,054
but we're still compact height,
但我们仍然高度紧凑,

392
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:51,824
so we're still getting that cyan there,
所以我们还在那青色,

393
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:53,626
Now, we could add another one, for example, right here,
现在,我们可以添加另一个,例如,在这里,

394
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:57,663
we could go add this one and say, what about any width and
我们可以添加这个,说什么任何宽度和

395
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:00,932
height is regular add a variation for that and
高度是定期添加一个变异和

396
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:05,036
go up here maybe we'll pick red for regular, and so
走在这里也许我们会选择红色的定期,所以

397
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:08,039
now any time the height is regular we're gonna see red,
现在任何时候高是正常我们会看到红色,

398
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:12,943
So let's go look at potrait>iPhone 7 Plus
所以我们去看写作者> iPhone 7 +

399
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:14,311
that's clearly regular,
这是明显规律,

400
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:16,613
How about iPad?
iPad呢?

401
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:18,582
Red, It's regular,
红色,它的常规,

402
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,916
Let's go iPhone,
让我们去iPhone,

403
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,417
Red, Regular height,
红色,常规的高度,

404
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:24,786
Let's go landscape,
让我们去风景,

405
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:26,888
Back to compact, so we get cyan,
回到紧凑,所以我们得到青色,

406
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,724
So you see how I'm just adding these variations,
所以你看到我只是增加了这些变化,

407
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,658
And you can do that for lots of different things,
你可以做很多不同的东西,

408
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:36,429
For example, when we look at this UI on an iPad,
例如,当我们看这个UI在iPad上,

409
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:38,065
it doesn't look that good,
它看起来不那么好,

410
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:41,200
Because, look how tiny all the fonts are here,
因为,看小字体都在这里,

411
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,103
Maybe we would want to go up here and add a variation when
也许我们会想去这里,当添加一个变化

412
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:48,540
it's regular, regular, okay, iPad only,
定期,定期,iPad,

413
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:51,777
where we increase the font on the buttons up to 80 or 90,
我们增加按钮上的字体到80年或90年,

414
00:19:51,846 --> 00:19:54,279
We could do that,
我们可以这样做,

415
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:56,581
That's not always gonna be the best way to do things like
这并不是总是会做事情的最佳方式

416
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,753
vary your font, but it's certainly possible to do that,
改变你的字体,但当然可以这样做,

417
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:05,288
Understand all that business?
理解所有的业务吗?

418
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:10,026
So, let's talk a little bit of how we are going to make this
让我们谈谈我们是如何让这个

419
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:16,333
UI do the five by four or the four by five thing here,
UI做五个由四个或者四个五个的事情,

420
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:19,035
And we know that we want to have as much
我们知道我们想要

421
00:20:19,104 --> 00:20:23,939
of the UI as we can that's common to both be shared,
常见的UI我们可以共享,

422
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:27,309
So, what I'm gonna do is try to
所以,我要做的是试着什么

423
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:30,645
work on that shared part of the UI here,
在这里共享UI的一部分工作,

424
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:33,782
And it doesn't really matter what device I'm looking at
它并不重要设备我看什么

425
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,715
while I'm doing this,
当我这样做,

426
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:35,883
Could be a iPhone Plus,
可能是一个iPhone +,

427
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:37,517
could be a regular iPhone, doesn't matter,
可能是一个常规的iPhone,无所谓,

428
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:41,455
because I'm editing stuff that applies to all size classes,
因为我编辑尺寸适用于所有类的东西,

429
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:43,122
And I'll show you in a moment how we're gonna edit stuff
一会儿,我将向您展示如何我们要编辑的东西

430
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:45,924
that applies to a specific size class,
适用于一个特定的大小类,

431
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:46,993
So how I'm gonna do this,
那么我要如何做到这一点,

432
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:49,562
you saw in the slides that really only this
你看到的真的只有这个幻灯片

433
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,898
part right here, these bottom 16 are common to all,
部分,这些底16是常见的,

434
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:56,767
These four across the top are either across the top or
这四个在顶部或顶部

435
00:20:56,836 --> 00:21:00,972
they're off, off to the left in a horizontally compact
他们,在水平向左紧凑

436
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,373
situation,
情况,

437
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:06,176
I'm gonna kind of have to unbundle all these things, so
我将不得不将所有这些东西,所以

438
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:10,280
let's start by just selecting this top level StackView and
让我们首先选择这个顶级StackView和

439
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:13,983
unstackviewifying it,
unstackviewifying它,

440
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:16,152
Take everything out of the StackView because clearly
把一切都StackView因为很明显

441
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,754
these things can't be inside that StackView,
这些东西不能StackView里面,

442
00:21:18,823 --> 00:21:20,889
And one thing to understand when you're doing these
一件事理解当你在做这些

443
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,592
size classes, you can have views come and
大小的类,你可以过来的看法

444
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:26,161
go based on size classes, but you can't have them come and
基于大小类,但你不能来

445
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:28,263
go inside StackViews,
进入StackViews,

446
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:31,465
It doesn't know how to put a view in inside another view,
它不知道如何将一个视图在在另一个视图中,

447
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:35,369
It has to be kind of a top level, coming and going, or
它必须是一种顶级,来来往往,或

448
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:37,904
inclusion or not inclusion,
包含或不包含,

449
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:39,606
So, how do we undo a stack view?
那么,我们如何撤销堆栈视图?

450
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,507
Actually you can just go to editor up here,
其实你可以去编辑,

451
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:43,943
the same place that we said embed in stack view,
相同的地方,我们说嵌入在堆栈视图中,

452
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:47,279
you can actually do unembed and that will take everything
你可以做unembed,将一切

453
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:50,816
out of stack view, back to where we were before,
堆栈视图,回到以前,

454
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:52,617
The other thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get rid of
另一件我要做的就是我要摆脱

455
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:54,953
all the constraints on here, cuz I had these constraints
这里所有的约束,因为我有这些约束

456
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:56,821
that were holding this to the edge, but they just don't
拿着这个边缘,但他们只是不

457
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,790
make any sense anymore cuz I've unbundled this,
任何意义了因为我分类定价,

458
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:00,891
So, how can I do that?
所以,我怎么能这样做呢?

459
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,292
Right down here in the lower corner where it says resolve
下在较低的角落它说的决心

460
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:05,528
auto layout issues,
自动布局问题,

461
00:22:05,597 --> 00:22:06,428
You can go down here and
你可以在这里

462
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:08,296
for all views in the view controller,
所有视图的视图控制器,

463
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:10,031
you can say clear constraints,
你可以说明确的约束,

464
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,998
So that's what I'm gonna go and
这就是我要去

465
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:13,601
it's gonna wipe out all the constraints in this
它会消灭所有的约束

466
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:15,135
view controller,
视图控制器,

467
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:15,836
Clear them all out,
都清楚了,

468
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:21,041
So now that I don't have the constraints in here,
所以现在我在这里,没有约束

469
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:23,809
I can move this staff around and kind of put
我可以移动这个员工,把

470
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:26,378
new constraints that I want on here and we can see that our
新的约束,我希望在这里我们可以看到

471
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:28,881
constraints are cleared because if I select something
约束被清除,因为如果我选择的东西

472
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:32,384
like this top label and I go to size inspector over here,
像上面的标签和我去尺寸检查器,

473
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:34,819
there's no constraint at the bottom,
没有约束的底部,

474
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:38,890
So let's go ahead and move this out of the way,
所以让我们继续和移动的方式,

475
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:41,726
Let's put this back tied to the top and
我们把这个与顶部和回来

476
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,595
left and right in exactly the same way as we did before,
左翼和右翼在我们之前做的完全一样,

477
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:45,496
So to kind of review,
这样的评论,

478
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,265
I'm just gonna control drag to the top notch,
我要控制拖动到顶尖,

479
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,732
I'm gonna do something interesting,
我要做一些有趣的事情,

480
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,602
I'm gonna Ctrl+Drag kinda up to the corner up here,
我要按Ctrl +有点拖到角落里,

481
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,972
When I do that, I can actually do both leading and
当我这样做,我可以做领导和

482
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,872
vertical space,
垂直空间,

483
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:59,341
And what I'm doing here to make,
我在这里做的,

484
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:02,843
to pick more than one constraint, is Shift,
选择多个约束,转变,

485
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,279
So, if you do Shift, you can pick more than one thing,
所以,如果你做改变,你可以选择一个以上的东西,

486
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:07,948
So here, I want both the leading edge on the left
这里,我想要两个左边的前缘

487
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:09,282
there, and the top edge,
,顶部边缘,

488
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:13,052
the vertical space to be tied, to be constrained,
相关的垂直空间,约束,

489
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:15,588
So, I just pick all the ones I want and then I click
所以,我只选择我想要的,然后我点击

490
00:23:15,656 --> 00:23:18,690
add constraints right here, and it adds those two,
添加约束,它增加了这两个,

491
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,926
And same thing, I can do this one over here then,
同样的事情,我可以做这个,

492
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:22,694
That's the trailing one,
拖着一个,

493
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:26,231
So now, when we look at our label up there,
现在,当我们看标签,

494
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,331
it's got these constraints,
它有这些限制,

495
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,000
That's good, that's what we want,
这很好,这就是我们想要的,

496
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:32,435
Now, what about this bottom constraint?
现在,这个底部约束呢?

497
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:34,971
Well, it use to be that the bottom of this was tied to
它使用,这是相关的底部

498
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,872
the top of this, and
的这个,

499
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,973
then the bottom of this was tied to the bottom of this,
然后与底部的底部,

500
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,075
But we can't do that anymore,
但是我们不能这样做了,

501
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:44,947
Because in five high by four wide, this is
因为在五高四宽,这是

502
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:48,450
gonna be on the top, but in four high and five wide,
会在上面,但在四个高,宽五,

503
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:51,953
these are gonna be over here and this is gonna be the top,
这些都是要在这里这是顶部,

504
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:56,123
So that's something we can't do in the any/any mode,
这是我们不能做的事在任何/模式,

505
00:23:56,192 --> 00:23:57,591
We just can't do it,
我们不能这样做,

506
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,826
But we can take this stack down view and
但我们可以把这个堆栈视图和

507
00:23:59,895 --> 00:24:02,395
put it down in this corner over here,
把它放在这里,这个角落

508
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:07,467
And use our same control drags
使用相同的控制拖

509
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:13,539
to do the trailing space there, and
那里的尾随空格,

510
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:18,610
the control drag to the bottom
控制拖到底部

511
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:24,115
to do the vertical space,
垂直空间,

512
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:25,817
So I've tied this thing to the bottom,
所以我把这个东西,

513
00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:29,053
So this actually works, in quotes,
这确实有效,在报价,

514
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:32,490
it works in both modes,
它能在两种模式下运行,

515
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,192
Keeps them both on screen it's doing what I said keeping
让他们两个在屏幕上做我所说的保持

516
00:24:35,261 --> 00:24:36,726
the display at the top and
顶部的显示

517
00:24:36,795 --> 00:24:38,428
keeping this stuff in the lower right,
在右下角,

518
00:24:38,497 --> 00:24:42,431
But it's clearly insufficient to do what we want in the two
但它显然不足以做我们想做的事

519
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,367
So, in the two cases, it's this stack view right here,
所以,在这两种情况下,这里的堆栈视图,

520
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:46,235
different cases,
不同的情况下,

521
00:24:46,304 --> 00:24:48,170
let me zoom in a little,
让我放大一点,

522
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:52,073
This stack view right here is the one that's at issue,
这个堆栈视图是一个问题,

523
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:53,708
So I'm just gonna take this thing and
所以我要把这个东西

524
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:56,444
lift it up out of the stack view, which you can do,
把它从堆栈视图中,你可以做,

525
00:24:56,513 --> 00:24:58,111
you can lift things up and out,
你能举起的东西,

526
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,147
So I lift it out and drop it, and it's sitting there,
所以我把它放,坐在那里,

527
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:05,853
Now it doesn't want to be in the any, any case at all,
现在不想要任何,任何情况下,

528
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,554
It wants to only be in certain size classes,
它希望只有在特定的大小类,

529
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:11,224
So, I'm going to take it and cut it, because I'm gonna
所以,我要把它切它,因为我要

530
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:15,561
paste it back in when we get to other size classes,
粘贴在其他大小类别时,

531
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:18,197
So this is our any/any right here,
这是我们这里的任何/,

532
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:21,233
This is the best we can do in terms of common UI to both
这是最好的我们可以做的两种常见的UI

533
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:25,504
the compact vertical case, and the regular vertical case,
紧凑的垂直情况下,常规的垂直情况下,

534
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:31,142
Now let's go on and do the compact case let's say,
现在让我们继续和紧凑的情况下假设,

535
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:33,344
Let's do the UI that's compact,
让我们做的UI紧凑,

536
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:36,780
Now since all the work that we're going to be doing right
既然所有的工作,我们要做的是正确的

537
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:40,784
now is only for the compact case we depress this super
现在是紧凑的情况下,我们只有这个超级压低

538
00:25:40,852 --> 00:25:44,054
important button right here, vary for traits,
重要的按钮,不同的特征,

539
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:47,523
This, this is what it's all about when it comes to doing
这个,这是都是什么时候做的

540
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:49,325
the size class variations,
类大小变化,

541
00:25:49,393 --> 00:25:53,395
So first you're gonna pick something that has the height
首先你要选择具有高度的东西

542
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:56,631
or width class or both that you want to vary,
或宽类或你想要改变,

543
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,633
So here I wanna do the horizontally or
这里我想做水平或

544
00:25:58,702 --> 00:26:02,103
the height compact, see height compact, I wanna do that one,
高度紧凑,看到高度紧凑的,我想做这个,

545
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:04,105
So this is a pretty good one to work in, but
这是一个很好的工作,但是

546
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:06,907
I can pick any of the ones that are height compact,
我可以选择任何的高度紧凑,

547
00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:09,076
And I'm gonna say vary for traits,
我会说不同的特征,

548
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:13,145
And I'm gonna vary in the height direction,
我要在高度方向上不同,

549
00:26:13,214 --> 00:26:15,882
Notice that that bar at the bottom turned bright blue,
请注意,底部栏变成明亮的蓝色,

550
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,351
That's to warn you, " watch out here
这是警告你,”看

551
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:22,688
now because you are editing UI only for height compact",
现在只因为你正在编辑界面高度紧凑的”,

552
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:25,223
And it's even showing you all devices that
甚至还显示你所有设备

553
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,191
are height compact,
是高度紧凑,

554
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,362
Which is all the iPhones, including the pluses,
这是所有的iphone,包括优点,

555
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:33,330
They're all in landscape, they're all height compact,
他们都在景观,它们都是高度紧凑,

556
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:34,465
and those are the only ones,
这些是唯一,

557
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:37,166
So all the editing we're doing now is only going to have
所以我们现在正在做的所有编辑只会

558
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:40,936
effect on these devices until we stop making this thing blue
影响这些设备,直到我们停止生产这个蓝色的

559
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:42,872
by pressing done varying,
按不同,

560
00:26:44,776 --> 00:26:47,909
So, building this UI now we can, here's the two
这个UI现在我们可以建设,这是两个

561
00:26:47,978 --> 00:26:50,512
big things you can do when in the blue mode here,
大事情你可以在蓝色的模式,

562
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:54,716
One is you can add views or remove views actually, and
一个是您可以添加视图或删除视图实际上,和

563
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:57,518
the other you can add constraints,
您可以添加约束,

564
00:26:57,587 --> 00:26:59,420
So, that's exactly what I wanna do here,
所以,这就是我想做的,

565
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:01,288
I wanna put those four buttons over here,
我想把这四个按钮,

566
00:27:01,357 --> 00:27:03,323
And then we wanna do some constraints to make those
然后我们要做一些让这些约束

567
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:05,024
buttons be in the right place,
按钮是在正确的地方,

568
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:08,595
So let's start by adding these back, remember I cut them so
让我们开始通过添加这些回来,记得我把它们

569
00:27:08,663 --> 00:27:10,229
I'm just gonna paste,
我要粘贴,

570
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,130
Here it is, here's that stack view that had them,
这是,这是堆栈视图,让他们

571
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:14,399
It used to be inside this stack view at the top,
以前在这个堆栈视图在顶部,

572
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:17,502
Now we wanna kinda put it on this side,
现在我们想把它放在这方面,

573
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:19,103
And when I put it on this side I want it to like
当我把它放在这方面我希望它喜欢

574
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:21,072
seem like it's inside the stack view,
似乎是在堆栈视图,

575
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,774
but I can't actually put it inside the stack view,
但是我不能把它内部堆栈视图,

576
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,209
Cuz like I said, this variation for
因为就像我说的,这种变化

577
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:28,511
traits cannot put things inside stock views,
不能把事情在股票的言论,

578
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,145
But it's a great opportunity for
但这是一个伟大的机会

579
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:32,781
me to show you other auto layout constraints that can
我告诉你其他自动布局约束

580
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,650
make it seem like it's in that stack view,
使它看起来像在堆栈视图,

581
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,919
And basically do the same thing that the stock view is
基本上股票的观点是做同样的事情

582
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:41,789
doing internally which is just adding auto layout constraints

583
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:43,457
to make things work,
使事情工作,

584

585
00:27:45,928 --> 00:27:47,060
vertical,
纵向

586
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:49,162
We want them up and down and that's simple to do,

We have this selected,
我们有一个选择,

588
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:52,398
I'm just gonna go to the attributes inspector and
我要去属性检查器

589
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,934
change the stack view to be vertical,
改变垂直堆栈视图,

590
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:56,568
So it's switching over to vertical,
切换到垂直,

591
00:27:56,637 --> 00:27:58,069
that's a really good start,
这是一个很好的开始,

592
00:27:58,138 --> 00:28:02,707
I could drag this up next to it and use the blue lines,
我可以拖这旁边,用蓝线,

593
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:05,109
That's nice, although the blue lines are probably not gonna
这很好,虽然蓝线可能不会

594
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:06,710
get it right here,
在这里,

595
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,379
If you notice when I drop that blue line down, look,
如果你注意到当我把蓝线,看,

596
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:11,714
it's trying to do all kinds of things,

598
00:28:15,253 --> 00:28:18,654
No, so I'm gonna do all my constraints here to make
没有,所以我要做我所有的约束条件

599
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:22,858
this hook up, I'm gonna do them all manually,
这个钩子,我要做手工,

600
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:25,628
Also it's a good chance to show you how to do them all,
也这是一个很好的机会向您展示如何做,

601
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:28,897
So what, how are we gonna make this vertical piece right
那么,我们要如何使垂直这一块

602
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:30,899
here, this vertical stack view,
在这里,这个垂直堆栈视图,

603
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:34,569
look like it's a part of this other stack view?
看起来这是一个其他堆栈视图的一部分吗?

604
00:28:34,637 --> 00:28:37,104
One thing we want to do is we clearly want the height of
我们想要做的一件事就是我们显然想要的高度

605
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,706
this stack view to always be tracking the height of
这个堆栈视图总是跟踪的高度

606
00:28:39,775 --> 00:28:41,074
the other one,
另一个,

607
00:28:41,143 --> 00:28:43,976
We want the top and bottom edges, basically, of this
我们想要的顶部和底部边缘,基本上,这一点

608
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:47,213
stack view and of this stack view to always be pinned,
堆栈视图和堆栈视图总是固定的,

609
00:28:47,282 --> 00:28:50,015
Well that sounds, pinning, sounds like a constraint,
那声音,锁住,听起来像一个约束,

610
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:52,818
We wanna constrain them, so, how can we do that?
我们想要约束他们,所以,我们该怎么做?

611
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:55,620
Here's how we do it, we're gonna select them both,
这是我们如何做,我们会选择它们,

612
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:58,489
A good way to select things, by the way, is dragging,
的一个好方法选择的事情,顺便说一下,拖着,

613
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:00,625
Dragging is a great way to select things,
拖是一个伟大的选择方式,

614
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,393
So I'm gonna select both of them right here,
所以我要选择他们两人在这里,

615
00:29:02,462 --> 00:29:05,529
And then I'm gonna use this menu down here,
然后我要用下面这个菜单,

616
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:08,432
Which is called the align menu, and that's exactly what
叫做调整菜单,这是什么

617
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:10,099
I wanna do, I wanna align these things,
我想做,我想使这些事情,

618
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:12,869
I click on it, and you can see that I can align things like
我点击它,你可以看到,我可以对齐之类的东西

619
00:29:12,938 --> 00:29:16,339
the centers or even the text base lines,
甚至文本中心基地,

620
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:18,540
But what I want here is that I wanna align the top
但是我想要的是我想让最高

621
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:19,308
and bottom,
和底部,

622
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:21,409
So I'm gonna click top and bottom,
所以我要点击顶部和底部,

623
00:29:21,477 --> 00:29:23,878
These numbers over here by the way are an offset,
这些数字在这里顺便提一下一个偏移量,

624
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:25,613
So if you wanted it to align the tops but
如果你想要它顶部对齐

625
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,148
you want one to be ten higher, you can put a ten in here,
十高,你想要一个你可以把一百一十年在这里,

626
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:30,016
But I want them be right along the top,
但我希望他们是对的在顶部,

627
00:29:30,085 --> 00:29:31,952
I wanna have the constraint where this is
我想这是有约束

628
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,954
exactly the same, this is exactly the same at all times,
完全相同的,这是完全相同的,

629
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,222
So I pick whichevers I want and
所以我选择哪个我要和

630
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,191
just say, add constraints and I added them,
只是说,添加约束和我说他们,

631
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:40,325
Now, woah,
现在,哇,

632
00:29:40,394 --> 00:29:44,429
it turn red, why am I getting those red lines right there?
它变红了,为什么我得到那些红线?

633
00:29:44,498 --> 00:29:47,398
Now, you can always find out about your
现在,你总是可以找到你

634
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:50,134
problems that you have with constraints by clicking on
通过点击问题与约束

635
00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:51,802
this little thing right up here,

636
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,604
You see this yellow guy, click on him and it says,
你看到这个黄色的家伙,点击他,它说,

637
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:57,974
the horizontal position is ambiguous for stack view,
堆栈视图的水平位置不明确,

638
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:00,242
Well, I've got multiple stack views, so
我有多个堆栈视图,所以

639
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:02,177
which one's it talking about,
哪一个的谈论,

640
00:30:02,246 --> 00:30:03,412
This is kind of a bummer,
这是一种劣势,

641
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:06,048
This is really just an overview of the errors,
这只是一个概述的错误,

642
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:07,783
Usually we don't look here,
通常我们不看这里,

643
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:11,152
The place we look is in the document outline okay,
文档大纲的地方我们是好的,

644
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,389
The document outline here which I have shown,
这里的文档大纲我已经表明,

645
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,191
I can hide it and show it,
我可以隐藏和显示它,

646
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,358
This is the place where for
这是对的地方

647
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:20,560
example we had to wire up to the refresh control,
例子我们必须刷新控制连接,

648
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:22,628
This is the place we go when it's hard to click on
这是我们去的地方当很难点击

649
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:24,597
something, cuz we can just click on a view here,
什么,因为我们可以在这里点击视图,

650
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:27,566
This is also the place we go to deal with all auto
这也是我们去处理所有的汽车的地方

651
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:29,000
layout problems,
布局问题,

652
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:32,270
And the magic place to look is this upper corner right here,
神奇的地方是这里的上角,

653
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:34,405
You see that red right there?
你看到那个红色的?

654
00:30:34,474 --> 00:30:37,274
This red is saying that there is either a lack
这个红色的是说要么是没有

655
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:39,242
of constraints or conflicting constraints,
的约束或相互矛盾的约束,

656
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:40,878
In other words, there are constraint problems that are
换句话说,有约束的问题

657
00:30:40,946 --> 00:30:44,780
so bad that your app is not going to work when you run,
如此糟糕,当你运行你的应用程序不会工作,

658
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:48,518
So we can click on this red thing and it will show us
所以我们可以点击这个红色的东西,它会告诉我们

659
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:51,487
all the details of all the constraint problems,
所有的约束的所有细节问题,

660
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:53,422
So now when we mouse over this,
现在当我们鼠标,

661
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:55,924
it still says need constraints for x position,
还是说需要约束x的位置,

662
00:30:55,992 --> 00:30:59,260
But we can find out which stack view it's talking about,
但我们可以找出哪些堆栈视图的谈论,

663
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:01,495
And of course, it's talking about that one,
当然,这是谈论这个,

664
00:31:01,564 --> 00:31:02,964
This other stack view over here,
这里的其他堆栈视图,

665
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:07,167
it has an x position, it's tied to the left edge,
它有一个x位置,与左边缘,

666
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:09,636
But this one is not tied to anything,
但这个不是绑定到任何东西,

667
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,504
It's top and bottom are tied but
顶部和底部是但挂钩

668
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:14,574
it could be sliding horizontally any which way,
可以是任何水平滑动,

669
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:15,874
So that's not tied, so
所以这不是挂钩,所以

670
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:18,978
we don't know where it's exposition is supposed to be,
我们不知道它是博览会应该是,

671
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,145
We need to fix that,
我们需要解决这个问题,

672
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,880
How are we gonna fix that?
我们要如何解决这个问题?

673
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:26,817
Well probably the best way to do that is to hook it up to
可能最好的办法,是连接到

674
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,952
the edge of this stack view,
这个堆栈视图的边缘,

675
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:33,256
Cuz if it, we tie this edge right here to this stack view,
因为如果它,我们把这个优势这个堆栈视图,

676
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,958
then it'll, its horizontal position will be set because
然后它会,将因为它的水平位置

677
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,460
it'll be tied to this guy's horizontal position,
它会与这个人的水平位置,

678
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,896
So how do we hook this guy up to here?
那么我们如何这家伙了吗?

679
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,932
Well we could of course control drag, all right, but
当然我们可以控制拖,好吧,但是

680
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:48,036
I'm gonna use this opportunity to show you a different way to
我要利用这个机会向你展示一个不同的方式

681
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:49,587
Which is I selected it and I'm going down to this other menu
这是我选择它,我要到另一个菜单吗

682
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:51,070
hook it up,
钩,

683
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,007
down here, this one that says add new constraints, and
这里,这个说增加新的约束,

684
00:31:54,076 --> 00:31:55,142
I'm clicking on it,
我点击它,

685
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,778
And we've actually seen this one briefly, I think,
我们已经看到这个简单,我认为,

686
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:01,547
But here you can do things like make things to be
但是在这里你可以让事情

687
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:03,049
affixed with,
贴,

688
00:32:03,117 --> 00:32:06,886
Or you can set the distance from your nearest neighbor,
或者你可以设置你的最近邻距离,

689
00:32:06,954 --> 00:32:07,720
That's what these are,
这就是这些,

690
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:09,287
These are the distance to the nearest neighbor,
这些都是距离最近的邻居,

691
00:32:09,356 --> 00:32:12,824
Now these little red I-beams are all grayed out right here
现在这些小红焊接都是灰色的

692
00:32:12,892 --> 00:32:14,792
or transparency'd out,
或者透明度会出来,

693
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:15,960
So right now,
现在,

694
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:19,729
this guy is not hooked up to his nearest neighbor at all,
这家伙不是连接到最近的邻居,

695
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:22,366
But we clearly wanna hook him up to his nearest neighbor on
但我们显然想钩他最近的邻居

696
00:32:22,435 --> 00:32:23,933
the right, that's this one,
正确的,这是这一个,

697
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:27,703
So, I'm gonna click this I-beam,it turns it on and now,
点击这个工字梁,它在现在,

698
00:32:27,772 --> 00:32:31,541
he's clamped to his nearest neighbor on the right and
他是他右边最近邻和夹紧

699
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:34,542
he's eight pixels away because that's what the dash
他因为这就是dash 8像素

700
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:36,845
blue lines put, but we dont want that,
蓝线,但是我们不希望这样,

701
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:39,548
we want ten pixels away, so we're gonna put ten,
我们想要10个像素,所以我们要把十个,

702
00:32:41,384 --> 00:32:44,752
We have 10 pixels away clamped to the nearest neighbor,
我们有10个像素夹到最近的邻居,

703
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,054
Let's add that constraint as well,
让我们添加约束,

704
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:50,090
Our red went away but now we have yellow,
我们的红色走了但是现在我们有黄色,

705
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,725
What does yellow mean in auto layout?
在自动布局黄色是什么意思?

706
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:55,227
Yellow means, "your constraints are okay and
好吧,黄色的意思,“你的约束

707
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,629
when you run it's probably gonna work, but
当您运行可能会工作,但

708
00:32:57,698 --> 00:33:01,066
what you're looking at in your storyboard is not
你看到在你的故事板不是

709
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:03,502
what your constraints are saying",
你的约束在说什么”,

710
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:07,572
Your constraints are not equal to what you see here,
你的约束不等于你在这里看到的,

711
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:10,708
You can see right here, for example, it's expecting
你可以看到在这里,例如,它的期望

712
00:33:10,777 --> 00:33:13,378
the X position of this stack view that's highlighted right
高亮显示的这个堆栈视图的X位置正确

713
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:16,547
here to be at 385, but it's actually at 387,
在385年,但它实际上是在387年,

714
00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:20,316
And if we zoom way in, in fact, with option,
如果我们放大方式,事实上,与选择,

715
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:22,185
There's a option zooming here,
这里有一个选择缩放,

716
00:33:22,254 --> 00:33:24,387
You can see there's a dashed yellow line,
你可以看到有一个黄色虚线,

717
00:33:24,455 --> 00:33:25,321
I don't know if you can see that,
我不知道你是否能看到,

718
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,955
Yeah, you can see that,
是的,你可以看到,

719
00:33:27,024 --> 00:33:29,358
This dashed yellow line, that's where the constraint
这个黄色虚线,这就是约束

720
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:31,926
system thinks this Stack View should be,
系统认为这个堆栈视图应该,

721
00:33:31,995 --> 00:33:35,062
The solid yellow line is where it actually is,
固体黄线是实际的地方,

722
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:39,399
And even the i-beam between the two has a little -2
甚至两者之间的工字梁有一个小2

723
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:42,169
right there, saying yeah, I got this i-beam here, but
说,是的,我这里的工字梁,但是

724
00:33:42,238 --> 00:33:46,173
it seems like it should be 2 points over to the left,
它似乎应该是2点左边,

725
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:48,208
How do we fix this,
我们如何解决这个问题,

726
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,343
When we have these yellow problems how do we
当我们有这些黄色的问题我们如何

727
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:54,713
get things to be put in the right place or something,
把事情放在正确的位置,

728
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,715
And the answer is we're gonna go over to our document
答案是,我们要去我们的文档

729
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,649
outline,
轮廓,

730
00:33:57,717 --> 00:33:59,783
By the way we can get here with the same way we got
顺便说一下我们可以在同样的方式

731
00:33:59,852 --> 00:34:02,620
to the red by clicking in this upper corner with the yellow,
点击在这上红色角落的黄色,

732
00:34:02,688 --> 00:34:05,990
And we're gonna click on this triangle cuz that's gonna,
我们要点击这个三角形因为会,

733
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:07,924
the string will let you resolve the problem,
绳子会让你解决问题,

734
00:34:07,993 --> 00:34:10,627
So, I click on it and actually have some choices
所以,我点击它实际上有一些选择

735
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:14,230
how to resolve that problem, one is I can update the frame,
如何解决这个问题,一个是我可以更新框架,

736
00:34:14,298 --> 00:34:17,800
that means move the views to match the constrains,
这意味着移动视图匹配约束,

737
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:20,035
which is definitely what I want in this case,
在这种情况下,绝对是我想要的

738
00:34:20,104 --> 00:34:23,071
Because I do want it to be 10 pixels apart there not eight,
因为我想要10个像素没有八,

739
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,639
But I could also do other things like
但是我也可以做其他的事情

740
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,407
updating the constraints,
更新的限制,

741
00:34:26,475 --> 00:34:30,778
And that would go and
这就去

742
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:34,181
Even thought I typed 10, this would clamp it back to 8, so
甚至以为我输入10,这将夹回8,所以

743
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,517
that it would match what's going on here,
这是怎么回事,它将匹配,

744
00:34:36,585 --> 00:34:39,119
Or you can do the dreaded reset to suggested
或者你可以做可怕的重置

745
00:34:39,188 --> 00:34:40,220
constraints,
的限制,

746
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:42,722
Which probably also would at least do that,
也可能至少会这样做,

747
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,957
probably do some other things we don't want,
可能我们不希望做一些其他的事情,

748
00:34:45,025 --> 00:34:47,692
In other words it kinda try do what the blue line said,
换句话说,它有点尝试做蓝线表示,

749
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:51,028
Reset to suggest the constraints we rarely use,
重置建议我们很少使用的约束,

750
00:34:51,097 --> 00:34:52,463
It's only good for when you're
只有当你

751
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:54,365
like dragging something right into the middle or
像拖到中间或东西

752
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:57,467
right out to the edges those kind of things,
对边缘的东西,

753
00:34:57,536 --> 00:35:00,069
It's not super good guessing what you want
这不是超级好猜你想要的

754
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:00,937
in other scenarios,
在其他情况下,

755
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,708
Now, this update frames, I can apply it just to
现在,这个更新框架,我可以将它应用到

756
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:08,310
this view right here that's having the problem or
这个观点有问题或

757
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:12,213
I can apply it to all the views in my entire controller,
我可以把它应用在我的整个控制器的所有视图,

758
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:14,082
And whether you have this switched or not,
你是否有这个交换,

759
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,018
it's about 50/50 when we switch this is whether you
当我们50/50开关这是你

760
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:19,487
have other views that you're in the middle of working on,
有其他观点,你在工作,

761
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:22,490
That you haven't quite fully specified their constraints,
你还没完全指定他们的约束,

762
00:35:22,558 --> 00:35:24,290
Then you'd probably don't want apply to all,
然后你可能不想要适用于所有,

763
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:26,192
because it's going to try to move them and
因为这是要他们和移动

764
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:28,528
you haven't finished specifying them,
你还没完成指定他们,

765
00:35:28,597 --> 00:35:30,595
But in this case,
但在这种情况下,

766
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:33,899
this is the only view that has any misplaced views, you see,
这是唯一的观点有错误的观点,你看,

767
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:35,967
So, I can go ahead and say all or not,
所以,我可以继续说,

768
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:37,035
It's not going to make a difference,
它不会改变

769
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:38,603
because this is the only one that is going to move,
因为这是唯一一个会移动,

770
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:40,004
I'm just going to leave it at all,
我要离开,

771
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:41,571
And I'm gonna say Fix,
我会说修复,

772
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,973
And you're gonna see that it moved it,
你会看到它移动,

773
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,441
Moved it two pixels over here,
这两个像素,

774
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,643
If we zoom in again here,
如果我们在这里再次放大,

775
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:52,414
we'll see now that this is tan, just like this is ten,
现在我们将会看到这是棕褐色的,就像这是10,

776
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,066
And it also says No Autolayout issues over here,
还说没有自动布局问题,

777
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:55,650
It moved it,
移动它,

778
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,253
If we go back here, there's nothing in the corner,
如果我们回到这里,没有什么在角落里,

779
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,720
All is well,
一切都好,

780
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:01,822
We're in good shape right there,
我们的身体状况很好,

781
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:04,758
Now, there's one other problem with this,
现在还有一个问题,

782
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:09,062
look how narrow these buttons are compared to these buttons,
看这些按钮,这些按钮比较窄

783
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,931
We want these buttons to be exactly the same width
我们希望这些按钮完全相同的宽度

784
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,966
as all of these buttons,
所有的这些按钮,

785
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:16,135
Now since it's not in the same stack view it's not getting
现在,因为它不是在相同的堆栈视图是没有得到

786
00:36:16,204 --> 00:36:19,038
the fill equally and so it's not getting that,
填充同样不是得到,

787
00:36:19,106 --> 00:36:21,807
So, how can I make these buttons inside this
所以,我怎么能让这些按钮在这个

788
00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:24,442
stack view right here be exactly the same width
堆栈视图在这里是完全相同的宽度

789
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:25,610
as the buttons over here,
的按钮,

790
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,981
Well, I'm going to just control drag,
好吧,我只是控制拖动,

791
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,783
Actually, I'm gonna control drag from the entire
实际上,我要从整个控制拖动

792
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:33,783
stack view,
堆栈视图,

793
00:36:33,852 --> 00:36:35,552
See I'm dragging from the stack view,
看到我从堆栈视图拖拽,

794
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:38,520
To any button over here and just say
在这里只说任何按钮

795
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:41,757
that I want it to be the same width as any button over here,
我想要任何按钮,宽度一样

796
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:43,392
So, we'll just pick this one and

here's all the things we can choose and

801
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,766
And I'm gonna add that constraint and

804
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:56,936
Again, I'll zoom in,
再次,我将放大,

805
00:36:58,306 --> 00:36:59,939
You can see the constraints right here,
你可以看到这里的约束,

806
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:00,839
This equals and

811
00:37:13,752 --> 00:37:14,817
constraints on there,

812
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:16,519
The only thing that's left is,

We're not connected to the whole space,

815
00:37:20,057 --> 00:37:22,457
Now here, we can do exactly what we did before,
现在,我们能做什么,

816
00:37:22,526 --> 00:37:25,726
I'm just gonna select this StackView right here,
我要选择这个StackView,

817
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:27,128
Not this one, but just this one,
不是这一个,只是这一个,

818
00:37:27,196 --> 00:37:29,663
I'm gonna Ctrl drag up to here and

I'm gonna set its vertical spacing,

Put's this I-beam in here to the top,
在这里把这是工字梁,

821
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,035
Now when I double-click on it,
现在我双击它,

822
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:38,871
Well also by the way, you know that we can click on these and
也顺便说一下,你知道我们可以点击这些

823
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,640
inspect them, remember that, so it's showing that this
检查他们,记住,这是显示这个

824
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:46,345
I-beam connects the stack views top to the displays
工字梁连接堆栈视图顶部显示

825
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:51,416
button and it sets them to be equal with an offset of 57,
按钮,它集相等的抵消57岁

826
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:53,084
That's what this constant is,
这就是这个常数,

827
00:37:53,152 --> 00:37:54,752
It's an offset of 57,
这是一个抵消57,

828
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:57,721
So that's why we're getting this 57 high bar,
这就是为什么我们要这57高酒吧,

829
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,556
And we don't want that,
我们不希望这样,

830
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:01,392
We want to change that to be standard value,

831
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,925
Actually, we don't even want standard value,

832
00:38:02,994 --> 00:38:06,496
we probably want 10 because we probably want this distance to
我们可能要10因为我们可能希望这个距离

833
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:09,565
be the same as the distance between all of our buttons,
同我们所有的按钮之间的距离,

834
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:10,833
I'm not sure which one we want but

835
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:12,935
I think that one's probably pretty good,
我认为一个人的可能很好,

836
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:17,571
So that's good now notice as soon as constrained the top of

837
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,141
this stack view to go up here it automatically dragged
这个堆栈视图上它自动拖

838
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,576
this stack view's top up there,
这个堆栈视图的顶部,

839
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:24,077
That's because we have a constrained
那是因为我们有一个限制

840
00:38:24,146 --> 00:38:26,713
that hooks the tops of these together,
钩子顶部的这些在一起,

841
00:38:26,781 --> 00:38:29,182
If I click on here, I look in the size inspector,
如果我点击这里,我看大小检查员,

842
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:32,551
you can see that I've got a line top to this top and
你可以看到我有一条线从上到上面

843
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,153
bottom to this other stack view,
这个其他堆栈视图,

844
00:38:34,221 --> 00:38:35,587
Do you see that?
你看到了吗?

845
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:36,187
So that's good,
这很好,

846
00:38:36,255 --> 00:38:37,155
What about this edge?
这条边呢?

847
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:40,091
Same thing here, we can just take this stack view and
这里也一样,我们可以把这个堆栈视图和

848
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,726
hook it to edge, this leading space to contain a margin,
钩边,这导致空间包含一个保证金,

849
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:44,861
just like we did before, and
就像我们之前做的,

850
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:48,698
here we get this, obviously we can inspect it over here,
这里我们得到这个,很明显我们可以检查它,

851
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:52,034
We can also double click on it to inspect it, which
我们也可以双击它检查它,

852
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:54,870
we saw before, and here I've picked standard value, there's
我们之前看到的,在这里我选择了标准的价值,有

853
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:57,639
no standard value available, so I'm just gonna do zero and
没有标准的价值,所以我要做零和

854
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:58,941
it's gonna zoom that think over,
它会放大,仔细考虑,

855
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:02,377
That's it,
就是这样,

856
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:04,311
So we've done everything we need to do no for

this height-compact situation,
这height-compact的情况,

858
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:08,882
And so,

00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:10,983
this is a very important thing to remember to do,
这是一个非常重要的是要记住,

860
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:14,653
When you're done, click Done varying down here,
当你完成,点击完成不同,

861
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:15,721
Because a lot of times you'll do this,
因为很多时候你会这样做,

862
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,055
and you're like all right it's working,
你喜欢好的工作,

863
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:19,691
And then, you'll go on to work on some other sized class, and
然后,你会继续工作在其他的类,和

864
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,526
you'll forgot to have clicked this off,
你会忘记了点击这个,

865

And now, you'll be editing only in the height-compact,
现在,你只会编辑height-compact,

866
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:26,497
So, we're gonna hit Done varying,

867
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,098
Get's rid of our blue,

has had no effect whatsoever on portrait,
对肖像没有任何效果,

874

875
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:47,481
And all that work we did here, every single bit we did since
和我们在这里做的工作,我们做的每一位

876
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,451
we clicked into the blue bar, only happens in high compact,
我们点击蓝色的酒吧,只发生在高紧凑,

877
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,188
So when we click back to portrait it looks just like it
所以当我们点击回到肖像看起来就像它

878
00:39:54,256 --> 00:39:59,625
used to, unaffected by all that work we did,

Make sense, understand why that happened?
意义,理解为什么,发生了什么?

880
00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:09,001
So now, we need to, in this case, the height regular case,
现在,我们需要,在这种情况下,常规情况下,高度

881
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:11,903
we need to put those buttons in along the top here,

you can kind of see a review of it,

884

885
00:40:18,077 --> 00:40:19,243
let's let this soak in a little bit,
让我们让这个浸泡在一点,

886
00:40:19,312 --> 00:40:21,645
because I wanna show you the document outline,
因为我想向您展示文档大纲,

887
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:23,446
So, I'm going over the document outline and

888
00:40:23,515 --> 00:40:25,181
I'm just gonna make it wider,

And why do you wanna make this wider?
为什么你想让这个更广泛?

890
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:30,452
Well, the document outline shows not only all your views,
嗯,不仅文档大纲显示你所有的观点,

891
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:33,989
but it also show all of your constraints,
但它也显示你所有的约束,

892
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:36,825
You see all these constraints down here?
你在这里看到所有这些限制?

893
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,893
And you notice that some of them are, like,

894
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:41,529
grayed out here,
灰色的,

895
00:40:41,598 --> 00:40:42,797
And why are they grayed out?
为什么他们是灰色的吗?

896
00:40:42,865 --> 00:40:46,332
Because they apply to a different size class
因为他们适用于不同大小的类

897
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:47,968
than is being shown here,
比所示,

898
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:51,971
We are looking at height regular, these grayed out
我们看着高度固定,这些灰色的

899
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:56,075
constraints are only over here in height compact,
限制只有在高度紧凑,

900
00:40:56,143 --> 00:40:57,476
So, when we go to height compact,
所以,当我们去高度紧凑,

901
00:40:57,545 --> 00:41:00,678
all of them apply because we haven't done any
所有这些,因为我们还没有做任何申请

902
00:41:00,747 --> 00:41:03,415
constraints that are in height regular only yet,
还只在高度常规约束,

903
00:41:03,483 --> 00:41:06,851
So, all of these apply in that circumstance,
所以,所有这些应用在这种情况下,

904
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,420
Now, looking at your constraints
现在,看你的约束

905
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:12,489
right here is a really good kind of tool for

915
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,445
So we don't like to see these magic numbers here,

916
00:41:37,513 --> 00:41:41,748
unless we intend for that magic number to be there,
除非我们打算让这神奇的数字,

917
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:45,751
So, 8 8 20, we never typed those in,

almost never do you want the canvas value,

it got rid of the plus eight,

962
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:34,045

right up to the edge right there,

I wanted to start doing height regular and

997
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:54,914
I didn't hit vary for traits, so

I wasn't acctually editing height regular,

If I go to my attributes inspector and

So, let's go ahead and constrain it for

it will automatically move them,

And then, you won't get the yellow,

1063
00:47:34,987 --> 00:47:36,453
You won't have to go over and

click, update frames and all that,

like there was when we did the other one,

It's not obvious that we need to do this but

1073
00:47:56,738 --> 00:47:59,338
the height of these just happens to to be the same

1074
00:47:59,407 --> 00:48:01,006
height as all of these,

And the other time it was obvious that they weren't,

drag from this stack view,

And then again I could do either an individual button or
然后我可以做一个单独的按钮或

1080
00:48:12,752 --> 00:48:15,185
one of these sub stack views right here,

1081
00:48:15,254 --> 00:48:17,520
And I'm gonna set them to be equal heights,

See the two equals that got generated there?

如果我们跑步,紧凑但我们有宽度

1107
00:49:30,486 --> 00:49:33,654
height is regular so we're getting five high and
